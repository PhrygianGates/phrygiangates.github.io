In this post, I would like to build some basics of differential geometry for understanding the Einstein Field Equations.

## 1. Riemann Tensor and Its Properties

### Definition of the Riemann Tensor:
The Riemann curvature tensor \( R^i_{jkl} \) is a fundamental object in differential geometry, representing the intrinsic curvature of a manifold. It is defined as:
\[
R^i_{jkl} = \partial_k \Gamma^i_{jl} - \partial_l \Gamma^i_{jk} + \Gamma^i_{km} \Gamma^m_{jl} - \Gamma^i_{lm} \Gamma^m_{jk}
\]
where \( \Gamma^i_{jk} \) are the Christoffel symbols.

### Properties of the Riemann Tensor:
1. **Bianchi Identity**:
   \[
   \nabla_m R^i_{jkl} + \nabla_k R^i_{jlm} + \nabla_l R^i_{jmk} = 0
   \]

2. **Symmetries**:
   - Antisymmetric in the last two indices:
     \[
     R^i_{jkl} = -R^i_{jlk}
     \]
   - Antisymmetric under swapping the first and second pairs:
     \[
     R^i_{jkl} = -R^j_{ikl}
     \]

3. **Applications**:
   - The Riemann tensor measures how much vectors are rotated or changed when parallel transported around a closed loop.


## 2. Geodesics and the Principle of Its Deduction

### Geodesic Equation:
A geodesic is the shortest path between two points in a curved space, and its equation is derived by minimizing the action:
\[
\int ds = \int \sqrt{g_{\mu \nu} \frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau} \frac{dx^\nu}{d\tau}} \, d\tau
\]
where \( g_{\mu \nu} \) is the metric tensor, and \( \tau \) is the affine parameter.

The variation of this action leads to the geodesic equation:
\[
\frac{d^2 x^k}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^k_{ij} \frac{dx^i}{d\tau} \frac{dx^j}{d\tau} = 0
\]
where \( \Gamma^k_{ij} \) are the Christoffel symbols.

### Key Insights:
- **Physical Meaning**: Geodesics generalize the concept of a straight line in curved spaces.
- The Christoffel symbols \( \Gamma^k_{ij} \) encode how the space is curved and influence the paths of geodesics.


## 3. Covariant Derivative and the Role of Christoffel Symbols

### Definition:
The covariant derivative generalizes the concept of a derivative to curved spaces, accounting for the change in the coordinate basis. For a vector field \( v^i \), the covariant derivative is:
\[
\nabla_j v^i = \partial_j v^i + \Gamma^i_{jk} v^k
\]
where \( \Gamma^i_{jk} \) are the Christoffel symbols.

### Intuitive Meaning of Christoffel Symbols:
The Christoffel symbols \( \Gamma^k_{ij} \) describe how the basis vectors change along a coordinate direction. For example:
\[
\partial_j \vec{e}_i = \Gamma^k_{ij} \vec{e}_k 
\]
This means that the derivative of the basis vector \( \vec{e}_i \) with respect to the \( j \)-th coordinate is a linear combination of the basis vectors. Intuitively, it measures how the coordinate basis "twists" or "stretches" in the manifold.


## 4. Geometric Derivation of Christoffel Symbols in Spherical Coordinates

### 1. Christoffel Symbol \( \Gamma^\phi_{\;r\phi} = \frac{1}{r} \)

#### Geometric Meaning:
The Christoffel symbol \( \Gamma^\phi_{\;r\phi} \) encodes how the vector \( \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \) (tangential to circles of constant \( r \) and \( \theta \)) changes as \( r \) varies. This captures the scaling of the \( \phi \)-basis vector due to the expansion or contraction of these circles.

#### Derivation:
1. Recall the expression for \( \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \) in spherical coordinates:
   \[
   \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} = r \sin\theta \, (-\sin\phi, \cos\phi, 0).
   \]

2. Differentiate with respect to \( r \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \biggl(\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}\biggr) = \sin\theta \, (-\sin\phi, \cos\phi, 0).
   \]

3. Factor out the original vector \( \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \biggl(\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}\biggr) = \frac{1}{r} \, \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}.
   \]

4. Interpretation:
   - This shows that the change of \( \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \) with respect to \( r \) is proportional to itself.
   - The proportionality constant is \( \frac{1}{r} \), which corresponds to \( \Gamma^\phi_{\;r\phi} \).

#### Physical Insight:
As \( r \) increases, the radius of the \( \phi \)-circle grows linearly with \( r \), causing \( \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \) (tangential to the circle) to stretch proportionally. This linear scaling is why \( \Gamma^\phi_{\;r\phi} = \frac{1}{r} \).

### 2. Christoffel Symbol \( \Gamma^\phi_{\;\theta\phi} = \cot\theta \)

#### Geometric Meaning:
The Christoffel symbol \( \Gamma^\phi_{\;\theta\phi} \) reflects how the vector \( \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \) changes when \( \theta \) varies. This describes the effect of the changing radius of circles at different colatitudes (\( \theta \)).

#### Derivation:
1. Recall the expression for \( \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} = r \sin\theta \, (-\sin\phi, \cos\phi, 0).
   \]

2. Differentiate with respect to \( \theta \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \biggl(\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}\biggr) = r \cos\theta \, (-\sin\phi, \cos\phi, 0).
   \]

3. Factor out \( \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \biggl(\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}\biggr) = \cot\theta \, \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}.
   \]

4. Interpretation:
   - The change of \( \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \) with respect to \( \theta \) is proportional to itself, with a proportionality constant \( \cot\theta \), which corresponds to \( \Gamma^\phi_{\;\theta\phi} \).

#### Physical Insight:
At different \( \theta \), the radius of \( \phi \)-circles is \( r \sin\theta \). As \( \theta \) changes, this radius scales with \( \cos\theta \). The rate of change relative to the radius is \( \cot\theta \), explaining why \( \Gamma^\phi_{\;\theta\phi} = \cot\theta \).
